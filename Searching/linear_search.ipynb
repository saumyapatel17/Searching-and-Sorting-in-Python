    "# Linear Search\n",
    "Linear search, also known as sequential search, is the simplest and most straightforward searching algorithm. It works by iteratively checking each element of the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. Despite its simplicity, linear search is a fundamental algorithm used in various applications, especially when dealing with small or unsorted datasets."

    "### How Linear Search Works\n",
    "- Start from the first element: Begin the search from the first element of the list.\n",
    "- Compare each element: Compare the current element with the target element.\n",
    "- Check for match: If the current element matches the target element, return the index of the current element.\n",
    "- Move to the next element: If the current element does not match the target element, move to the next element.\n",
    "- Repeat the process: Continue this process until either the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.\n",
    "- Return result: If the target element is found, return its index. If the target element is not found after checking all elements, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "- Initialize the index variable to 0.\n",
    "- Loop through each element of the list:\n",
    "    - If the current element matches the target element, return the current index.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, move to the next element by incrementing the index.\n",
    "- If the loop completes without finding the target element, return -1."
