    "# Ternary Search\n",
    "Ternary search is an algorithm designed for searching in sorted arrays, similar to binary search. However, instead of dividing the search space in half, ternary search divides it into three parts. It is particularly efficient for finding the maximum or minimum value of a unimodal function, but it can also be used for general searching."

    "### How Ternary Search Works\n",
    "Ternary search works by dividing the search interval into three equal parts and discarding one-third of the search space in each iteration. It requires the array to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize Pointers: Start with two pointers, left and right, representing the start and end of the search interval, respectively.\n",
    "- Divide the Search Space: Calculate two midpoints, mid1 and mid2, dividing the search interval into three equal parts.\n",
    "- Compare Values: Compare the target value with the values at mid1 and mid2.\n",
    "    - If the target value is equal to the value at mid1 or mid2, return the index of the matching element.\n",
    "    - If the target value is less than the value at mid1, discard the right third of the search space by updating right to mid1 - 1.\n",
    "    - If the target value is greater than the value at mid2, discard the left third of the search space by updating left to mid2 + 1.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, the target value must lie between mid1 and mid2, so discard the outer two-thirds of the search space by updating left to mid1 + 1 and right to mid2 - 1.\n",
    "- Repeat: Continue this process until the target value is found or the search interval becomes empty."
