    "# Jump Search\n",
    "Jump search is an algorithm for searching in a sorted array. It is an improvement over linear search by attempting to reduce the number of comparisons needed. The basic idea is to jump ahead by fixed steps and then perform a linear search within the identified block where the target element might be located."

    "### How Jump Search Works\n",
    "Jump search operates by dividing the array into smaller blocks of a fixed size, then jumping from block to block. If a block is found where the target element could be located, a linear search is performed within that block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a Jump Size: Select a block size or jump step. A common choice is the square root of the size of the array (m = sqrt(n)), where n is the number of elements in the array. This minimizes the number of jumps and comparisons.\n",
    "- Jump Through the Array: Start at the beginning of the array and jump ahead by the block size until the value at the current index is greater than or equal to the target value or the end of the array is reached.\n",
    "- Perform Linear Search: Once the block where the target could reside is identified, perform a linear search within that block to find the exact position of the target value.\n",
    "- Return the Result: If the target value is found, return its index. If the target value is not found, return -1."
