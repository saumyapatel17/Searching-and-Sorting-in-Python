    "# Timsort\n",
    "**Timsort** is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. It is designed to perform well on many real-world data sets and is the default sorting algorithm in Python (`sort()` method for lists). Timsort exploits runs (already sorted subsequences) in the data and merges them efficiently."

    "### Algorithm (How It Works):\n",
    "1. **Divide the Array into Runs**:\n",
    "   - Split the array into small runs (default size 32 or smaller).\n",
    "   - Sort each run using Insertion Sort because it is efficient for small arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merge Runs**:\n",
    "   - Use a merge process similar to Merge Sort to combine the sorted runs into larger runs.\n",
    "   - Timsort uses specific rules to balance merging runs, avoiding unnecessary overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimize**:\n",
    "   - Exploits natural runs (already sorted sequences in the data).\n",
    "   - Ensures stable sorting and avoids unnecessary merges."
